<h1> Drawings</h1>
<p> In the past I had a lot more time to myself, I drew a lot of artwork during my high school years. In recent years I have drawn less because I often have three hours plus to myself, but I still do try to draw every now and again. When I do draw I mostly make monsters and science fiction artwork but I have done a few pictures of animals as well. </p>

<p> The first picture on the left is a tribal style Bull with the chinese character for strength, I used charcoal to color in the bulk of the background and shapes that make up the bull, I then used colored pencil to fill in the rest of the piece.</p>

<p> The middle picture is one of the first pieces that I actually tried to draw well and not just doodle. </p>
