<h1> Dishes</h1>
<p> During my time at CIA I was required to make a portfolio of all of the dishes we made. I still have a few of those pictures left over from my time there, in addition I also have a few pictures of dishes I have made since.</p>

<img src="Dexter%20Cake.JPG"width="400">
<p> This was a cake I made for my high school senior baking final, it is a red velvet cake that was frosted with butter cream icing, and decorated with hard candy shards to replicate Dexter's broken blood slides, and colored corn syrup to stand in for the blood on the slides.</p>
<img src="Fines%20Herb.JPG"width="400">
<p> This is one of the first dishes I made at the CIA, it was chicken with fines herbs, fresh pasta that was colored with tomato paste, and tourne vegetables. </p>
<img src="Hot%20Sauce.JPG"width="400">
<p> This is one of my more recent hot sauces that I have made, it had three kinds of pepper in it as well as some grapefruit for a bit of sweetness. </p>
